# gavinmogan.com

I was playing around with react again, and decided to actually setup some content on gavinmogan.com. I really just wanted to see if I could somewhat easily generate a static site. Its a little clunky in places but does work, and can be cleaned up in the future.

# Build

```
npm install
./node_modules/.bin/webpack
```

See dist dir

# Developer

```
npm install
node server.dev.js
```

Profit
